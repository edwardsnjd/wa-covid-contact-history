WA COVID Contact Locations
==========================

A work in progress to automatically scrape and collect the WA COVID contact location data in a cleaner form than [the available HTML](https://www.wa.gov.au/government/covid-19-coronavirus/covid-19-coronavirus-locations-visited-confirmed-cases)

This uses the awesome [Git scraping technique described by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) with a little javascript parsing script to do the conversion from HTML to JSON.
